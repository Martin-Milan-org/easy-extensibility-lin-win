# easy-extensibility README

Extend VSCode without the ceremony of making a full extension! Just write your code anywhere and it'll be part of VSCode!

## TODO Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Development

0. `cd ~/easy-extensibility; npm ci`
1. `code ~/easy-extensibility`
2. `F5`
3. In the new VSCode instance, `Cmd+Shift+P` then `Hello World` to see things run.

## TODO Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## TODO Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## TODO Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.
